# 🖐️ Sign Language Detector ✨

This project is an interactive application that recognizes hand gestures and translates them into sign language letters in real-time. This tool bridges the communication gap with the help of Machine Learning! 


🎯 How It Works:      
- Capture: Live video feed captures your hand gestures 📷.      

- Detect: MediaPipe tracks hand landmarks in real-time.      

- Predict: TensorFlow Lite model analyzes the hand position and predicts the sign language letter 🧠 .          

- Display: The letter appears instantly on the GUI!      

❤️ Made with a passion for accessibility and sign language communication.      
Created to make a small but meaningful difference. 🌍🤗
